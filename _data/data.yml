career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      After more than 10 years in software development industry,
      I feel a good potential to navigate big projects, startups, challenges etc. 
      One of my best achivements in life is handling family and work proffecionally.
      I'd like to work remotely because I'm multitask personality and do not have good experiences with on-site teams.
      Most of the time it waste my time to working in open office, except when I should teach others.
      As I were mountain climber, I enjoy adventuring and walk on edge. But about production issues, I'm very sensitive to keep data and user experience safe.
